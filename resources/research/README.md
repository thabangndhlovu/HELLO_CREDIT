# Hello Credit 

### Description:

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the probability of deafault. 


### Universe
* Local Market


Data Preparation:

* Bloomberg Python API
* Credit Metrics


Model Development:

Several machine learning models were evaluated for the task of credit risk prediction. The models were trained on a subset of the data, and their performance was evaluated on a held-out test set. The model with the best performance was selected for deployment.

Evaluation:

The performance of the selected model was evaluated on the held-out test set. The model was able to accurately classify applicants into high-risk and low-risk categories. The model's performance was also compared to a traditional credit scoring model. The machine learning model outperformed the traditional model in terms of accuracy and precision.

Deployment:

The selected machine learning model was deployed into a production environment. The model is now being used to assess the creditworthiness of new loan applicants.

Conclusion:

This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning for credit risk prediction. The developed model can help lenders to make more informed decisions about loan applications and reduce their risk of default.

Future Work:

Explore the use of deep learning models for credit risk prediction.
Develop models that can predict the probability of specific types of defaults, such as late payments or bankruptcy.
Integrate the machine learning model with other credit risk assessment tools.
