  "credit_analysis": {
    "summary": "The company's financial metrics indicate a deterioration in creditworthiness over time, characterized by increased leverage and declining profitability. Key ratios such as debt-to-equity and debt-to-EBITDA suggest heightened financial risk, while continuously low EBITDA margins and sales growth may hinder the company's ability to service its debt obligations effectively.",
    "key_strengths": [
      "The company has maintained a relatively strong EBITDA-to-interest expense ratio, averaging 3.52, indicating adequate coverage of interest expenses, which is a positive signal regarding its ability to meet interest payments.",
      "Asset turnover remains above the historical average of 0.801, reflecting efficient use of assets in generating sales.",
      "Despite fluctuations, the company shows resilience in maintaining a reasonable cash-to-assets ratio, averaging 11.60, which suggests a solid liquidity position."
    ],
    "potential_risks": [
      "The debt-to-equity ratio has increased significantly, reaching 5.62, which is substantially higher than the historical average of 2.37. This escalated leverage poses a risk to financial stability and may lead to increased borrowing costs.",
      "The debt-to-EBITDA ratio has also surged to 25.82, far exceeding the average of 10.06, indicating that the company's debt levels are unsustainable relative to its earnings potential.",
      "Profitability metrics such as the EBITDA margin have shown a downward trend, with the latest value at -2.79 compared to the average of 10.15, raising concerns about the company's operational viability and capacity to generate profits."
