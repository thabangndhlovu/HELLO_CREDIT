  "overall_analysis": "The company demonstrates a trend towards improved creditworthiness, marked by a significant decline in leverage ratios and a notable increase in profitability metrics. The decreasing debt-to-equity ratio indicates a reduction in financial risk, while the rising EBITDA margin reflects enhanced operational efficiency. This combination suggests a resilient financial structure capable of sustaining debt obligations and supporting future growth. However, the company must continue to monitor its operational efficiency and maintain strong profitability to mitigate any potential risks associated with external economic fluctuations.",
